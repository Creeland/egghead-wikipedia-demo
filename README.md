# Build an Angular 2 Instant Search Component

## About this repo

This repo contains the example code for the Eggheadio `Build an Angular 2 Instant Search Component` course. Each lesson is in it's own branch with the code relevant to that lesson. In each branch there is a link to a plunk where the code is ran. If the repo is downloaded locally just run `npm install` and `ng serve`.

## Course Description

In this course you will learn more about using observables in Angular 2. We are going to explore the new HTTP service, and how we can leverage the power of observables and RxJS to build a rock solid instant search component with a handful of operators.

You will learn operators like `map`, `distinctUntilChanged`, `debounceTime`, `merge`, `flatMap`, and `switchMap` by applying them to a real-world component. By the end of this course you will have a clear understanding of how components can be designed around the concept of event streams which are wired together like modular building blocks.

All of this in about 11 minutes! ðŸ˜„
